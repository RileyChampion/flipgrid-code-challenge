## Project Description

For this coding challenge I was instructed to create a simple sign up page which redirects to a sign up view. The tools I used for this project were **VueJS** along with **Vite** to compile and create quick builds of the application. During this project I accomplised the following requirements:

- [x] ðŸŽ¨ Make submission look as close to the mockup as possible
- [x] ðŸ“± Make page dynamically adapt to screen size
- [x] ðŸ’» Deploy the project via GitHub Pages --> Website found [here](https://rileychampion.github.io/flipgrid-code-challenge/)

In addition to the above requirements I also included the following features to the application:
- [x] Validation of the sign-up fields using regular expressions
- [x] Button users can press to toggle light mode or dark mode

Below I've included a small visual demo of the project!
